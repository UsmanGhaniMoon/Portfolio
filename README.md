Usman Ghani – Full Stack Web Developer
Portfolio & Project Showcase

👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a full stack web developer with professional expertise in Laravel, Vue.js, React, Node.js, MySQL, CodeIgniter, WordPress, and the MERN stack. I specialize in crafting modern, scalable, and maintainable web applications.

🚀 Getting Started with This React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App and is powered by Bun instead of npm.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

bun dev
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

bun test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

bun build
Builds the app for production.

bun eject
Copies configuration and dependencies, allowing for full customization (irreversible).

📌 Note: This app uses Bun instead of npm for performance and simplicity.
