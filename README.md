## 🚀 Getting Started with This React App

This project was bootstrapped using **Create React App** and is powered by **[Bun](https://bun.sh/)** — a modern JavaScript runtime offering blazing-fast performance.

### 📦 Available Scripts

Run the following commands in the project directory:

- `bun run start` — Starts the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
- `bun test` — Runs tests in watch mode  
- `bun build` — Builds the app for production  
- `bun eject` — Ejects the app for full customization (irreversible)

> ⚡️ **Note:** This app uses **Bun** instead of `npm` for improved speed and simplicity.
